# Babelfish for PostgreSQL

Babelfish for PostgreSQL is an open-source project that adds a Microsoft
SQL Server-compatible end-point to PostgreSQL. Babelfish allows PostgreSQL to
understand T-SQL, SQL Serverâ€™s proprietary SQL dialect, and supports the TDS
communication protocol, so applications originally written for SQL Server may
work with PostgreSQL with fewer code changes and without changing database
drivers.

This repository contains the release distributions for the Babelfish project.
Each distribution contains the source code for Babelfish as well as the
corresponding PostgreSQL version and some prerequisite software.

Additional Github repositories contain:

- [Babelfish project source code](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/babelfish_extensions).
- [PostgreSQL source code](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql/postgresql_modified_for_babelfish)
  that has been modified for use with Babelfish.
